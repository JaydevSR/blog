Clouds had been slowly taking over the sky since afternoon. I knew it was going to rain but the faint lightning in the sky attracted me. I couldn't just sit in my dark room, by the way which was dark to keep the bugs out. Usually, I don't like to stay outside with lightning over my head but this time it was at some great distance so I went for a walk.

I love solo walks. This is not an overstatement. And I specially like them with some music. I put on Beethoven's 'Kreutzer', which I wanted to listen to again after hearing it in an anime. It was hitting the mood just right and got me lost in my own world. And then it happened. The rain.

I was not running at first but I had no power over the mighty clouds I would say. They showed me my place. I started running quickly, the sonata was reaching its end as well and just when the last note struck I made it to where I was running to, the hostel entrance.

Usually I am egocentric and would tend to build the world around me but not this time. Maybe because of sunday evening mood and the music, I don't know. But I realised one thing for sure, **it was raining and it was not for me**.

It was neither raining for me nor for the people around me. It would have rained even if we were not there. Such realisation is not good for the human nature. We want to feel important, wanted and probably also immortal by the virtue of the deeds. But no cloud has ever paid attention to such desires because they are part of something truely immortal. But this thought calmed me.

Rains have always had a calming effect on me. I never dug in deep to find the reason but this evening it came to me. I feel calm when I am not the origin of my world. I always used to sit in my window while it was raining back home and feel the tiny droplets on my face. The droplets felt cold but my heart always felt warm and it dissolved the cage around me for me to build again. This was probably the start of my romance with the monsoon. So, I balantly claim monsoon to be my favorite season despite hating mud and, loving mangoes in summer and sleeping under a heavy blanket in winter more than anything. I still haven't found many people making such claims but it is what it is.
