I am Jaydev Singh Rao. I am currently an undergraduate student in India. This website is a blog which is quite obvious but I need to fill some lines. You can find out more about me on my personal [homepage][personal-page]. Thanks for visiting!

I built this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Kagami](https://github.com/kamikat/jekyll-theme-kagami) theme.
